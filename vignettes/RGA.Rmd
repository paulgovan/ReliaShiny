## Landing

## Data

For demonstration, we'll use the preloaded "Simple Data" dataset. First, navigate to the Reliability Growth menu and click on the Data sub-menu. Next, under the Data Selection box, select "failures" as the Failure Column.

At this stage, your app should resemble the following:

You can explore additional options for data arrangement, but for this example, we'll proceed with the default settings.

## Modeling

Next, navigate to the Model sub-menu to build your Reliability Growth model. The app will generate a Reliability Growth Plot using default settings. Feel free to experiment with different configurations to tailor the model to your needs.

Next to the plot, youâ€™ll find additional settings for further customization.

Finally, visit the Duane Plot tab to create a Duane plot. As with the previous plot, various customization options are available.

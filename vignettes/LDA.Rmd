## Landing

Upon launching the app, you'll be greeted by the Landing page. From here, you can:

* Access the Project Site.
* Download an example dataset.
* Navigate to the Time-to-Failure menu.

## Data

For demonstration, we'll use the preloaded "Time-to-Failure" dataset. First, navigate to the Time-to-Failure menu and click on the Data sub-menu.

At this stage, your app should resemble the following:

You can explore additional options for data arrangement, but for this example, we'll proceed with the default settings.

## Modeling

Next, navigate to the Model sub-menu to build your Weibull model. The app will generate a Probability Plot using default settings. Feel free to experiment with different configurations to tailor the model to your needs.

Next to the plot, youâ€™ll find additional settings for further customization.

Finally, visit the Contour Plot tab to create a contour plot. As with the previous plot, various customization options are available.
